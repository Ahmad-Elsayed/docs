### 2.1 Types of Vendors

The [Mendix Vendor Program](https://www.mendix.com/marketplace-vendor-program/) includes opportunities for a variety of types of partners (for example, app service vendors, solution vendors, and startups). There are three types of specific vendor programs at Mendix:

Whether you are supplying an app service or a solution as an individual with your own business or you are acting on behalf of your organization, you will be in great company by joining the Mendix Vendor Program.  We only need some key information from you before you are ready to offer your product through the Mendix Marketplace. Mendix will work with you throughout the application process to make your submission experience as simple as possible.

### 2.2 Applying to the Mendix Vendor Program

Whether you are an individual supplier with your own business or you are supplying an app service or solution on behalf of your company, your first step is to make sure you have a [Mendix Platform account](https://signup.mendix.com/). This is necessary, since your Mendix Vendor account will be associated with your Mendix ID.

Next, you need to [apply to the Mendix Vendor Program](https://www.mendix.com/marketplace-vendor-program/#contactForm). In the application, you will be asked for some basic information, including your legal name and address. This is used to check whether you want to sell your app service or solution, or offer it for free.

| Account Detail | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Account Owner | The account creator’s email address. |
| Logo | Your supplier logo. |
| Name | Supplier name (could be a company, brand, or individual). |
| Description | Describe your purpose, products, and services. |
| Company Name | The legal name of the entity that will sell or offer your free content. |
| Company Address | The legal address of the entity that will sell or offer your free content. |

As the owner of the Mendix Vendor account, you must have permission to legally bind your company to Mendix.

If you want to offer paid content, you must also provide the following details:

| Account Detail | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Bank Name | The name of the branch where the account is held. |
| Bank Address | The address of the branch where the account is held. |
| Account Number | The account number for the legal entity or individual. |
| Account Holder Name | The name registered with the account. |

### 2.3 Mendix Vendor License Agreement {#vendor-license}

Whether you are offering a free or paid app service or solution through the Marketplace, you need to accept our Mendix Vendor License Agreement, which is an agreement between Mendix and you as a Mendix Vendor within the Mendix Vendor Program.

For ease of reference, here are some of the main points of the license agreement you need to be aware of:

[**VENDOR LICENSE AGREEMENT APPLIES TO BOTH APP SERVICES AND SOLUTIONS?**]

* Content must be free from any known security vulnerabilities
* Content must not contain default passwords, authorization keys, or any other credentials
* Content must not include software that collects and exports customer data without the customer's knowledge and express consent
* You must define the applicable laws, treaties, regulations for your content, including, without limitation, those related to export control, data privacy, international communications, and the transmission of technical or personal data
* Content must be production-ready and must include a defined support policy
* Mendix reserves the right to reject content that does not comply with these guidelines or the requirements described in the license agreement

### 2.4 Legal & Compliance Checks

The company registered with your account is the legal entity against which Mendix will be bound. For this reason, Mendix performs screening checks to ensure we are legally permitted to undertake business transactions together.

In addition, before your content can be published in the Marketplace, it must be classified for export to the countries in which it will be sold and for how it will be used. For details, see the [Export Control](as-sell#export-control) section of *How to Sell Your App Service in the Marketplace*.
