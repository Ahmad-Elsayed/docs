## 1 Introduction

This section provides information and guidance on how to develop solutions you can sell both on and off the Mendix Marketplace.

## 2 What Is a Solution?

A solution is any Mendix app that is suitable to be sold to multiple different customers. This means the app is built to match the needs and expectations of a wider range of customers. Sometimes this means the app is configurable at runtime to better cater to the needs of groups of customers. In this case, general Mendix development [best practices](/howto/general/dev-best-practices) apply, and you can get started building a solution with any template available on the Mendix Platform.

Customers often require more from a solution than it supports out of the box. Whether it is an integration with an existing system in the customer's IT landscape, a change to better match the processes of the customer, or simply an adjusted UI to better match the brand of the customer, these adaptations require more than just a prescriptive software-as-a-service (SaaS) solution. This means you need to enable the solution to be adapted so that it can fit the specific needs of a customer.

To get started on building solutions, see [Architecting Adaptive Solutions](sol-architecting). Then, continue reading how to apply [IP Protection](sol-ip-protection) to make your solution ready to sell to customers.

## 3 Vendor Programs

Mendix introduced the Solution Vendor Program to support the full range of organizations—from startups to large enterprises—looking to develop solutions. Under beneficial terms, Mendix provides independent software vendors (ISVs) and startups with a Mendix license for the development and operation of Mendix apps to implement solutions for their customers.

Mendix supports aspiring solutions vendors and startups in their adoption of Mendix as a development platform for their solutions. The Mendix Solution Vendor Program and Mendix Startup Program teams are the point of contact for any inquiries, including requesting access to early-adopter stage technologies like intellectual property protection.
