## 1 Introduction

The Mendix Projects API allows you to create, edit or delete your projects.

## 2 Authentication {#authentication}

Authentication for the Projects API uses a personal access token (PAT).

### 2.1 Generating a PAT {#generate}

For details on how to generate a PAT, see the [Personal Access Tokens](/community-tools/mendix-profile/user-settings/#pat) section of *User Settings*.

Select the appropriate scopes, depending on the endpoints that need to be invoked. Refer to the [API Reference](#api-reference) for more information on which scopes to use in which endpoints.

Store the generated value somewhere safe so you can use it to authorize your API calls.

### 2.2 Using the PAT

Each request must contain an `Authorization` header with the value `MxToken {GENERATED_PAT}`. For example:

```http {linenos=false}
GET /projects HTTP/1.1
Authorization: MxToken 7LJEâ€¦vk
```

## 3 API Reference{#api-reference}
