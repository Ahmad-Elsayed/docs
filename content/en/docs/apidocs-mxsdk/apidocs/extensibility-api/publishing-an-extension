## 1 Introduction

This document helps you to create an extension add-on module, so that you can publish it to the marketplace.

## 2 Setup

To be able to export extensions add-on modules, you need to have the feature flag `--enable-extension-development` enabled.
See the getting started guide for how to do this. 

To create a extension add-on module that you can upload to the marketplace, follow the procedure below:

1. In the app that contains your development extension, create a new module with the same name as your extension folder. If you extension folder is called 'MyFirstExtension', your module should be called 'MyFirstExtension'.
2. Open the module settings and go to the 'Export' tab
3. Set module type to 'Add-on module'
4. In the 'Extension Name' field, select the name of your extension. This should match with your Module name.
{{% alert color="info" %}} If you do not set the 'Extension Name' field, your feature flag is not configured correctly. See the getting started guide to do this. {{% /alert %}}
5. Click 'OK' to save the settings, and export the module. 
You can now distribute the add-on module via the marketplace to share the extension with other Studio Pro developers.
