### New Features


X-Ray mode is a way to better visualize the structure of your page while in Design Mode. It adds a special border around certain widgets, like layout grids and containers, while keeping most of your apps styling the same.

X-Ray mode was first introduced as an experimental feature, enabled by default only on Mac OS. In this release, we are enabling X-Ray mode for everyone.

For more information, see [X-Ray Mode](/refguide/page/#x-ray-mode).

#### Non-interrupting Timer Boundary Events

- We have added non-interrupting boundary events as a beta feature. This feature triggers a boundary flow if an activity exceeds its expected duration, based on a timer that is defined on the boundary event.
A boundary flow runs in parallel to the workflow activity they are attached to, without interrupting the main process.
These events can be applied to key suspendable activities such as User Tasks (Single and Multi), Call Microflow, Call Workflow, and Wait for Notification, providing more flexibility in workflow management.

For more information, see [Boundary Events](https://docs.mendix.com/refguide/workflow-boundary-events).


### Improvements

- We improved performance of the auto-completion popup in the expression editor.
- Objects that are returned in a Call External Action activity are now uniquely identified using their remote key (if available). This allows you to associate local objects to external objects that are returned from OData actions.
- We have upgraded bundled Node.js version from v16 to v20.
- We now throw a consistency error when a page or microflow without any roles has a URL configured.
- Error messages are improved for connection errors when triggering an action or a datasource. (Ticket 218338)
- Default values are now supported for action properties in pluggable widgets. An action property can have a defaultType and defaultValue. The defaultType can be set to call a microflow, call a nanoflow, or open a page.

- You can now use expressions for conditional visibility and dynamic classes without a surrounding data container. This simplifies modeling as you no longer need to add a wrapping data container when you are only using variables which are available at top level, e.g. page parameters, selections and constants. This feature is not available for data grid 1, template grid and under some conditions list view.

- The overview pages generation dialog now allows to overwrite previously generated folders.
- We added an ability to create Studio Pro memory snapshots.

- Weâ€™ve optimized the performance of the Properties Tool Window when editing pages, enhancing responsiveness.
- In the case of a foreign key constraint violation during a commit, a `ForeignKeyConstraintViolationException` is now thrown. The error message is now uniform for all supported database vendors and is easier to understand than before.
- We added support for MariaDB 11.4.
- We added support for MySQL 8.4.

* We upgraded the JDBC driver for Microsoft SQL Server to version 12.8.1.
    * If you connect to SQL Server using integrated security in a module such as [Database Connector](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/2888), you may need to update the JDBC driver in `userlib` as well.
- We added hyperlinks for collecting feedback on published-Graphql services via survey.
- We now clean up anonymous users after a REST call finishes.
- The Studio Pro commit dialog always displays all the tabs. The tab titles indicate the number of changes, and the default focus is set to the tab with more than zero changes.

- We added new items into Support Tools under Help menu option. To read more about "Project Context" and "Background" read the documentation.

- We added enw support option under help menu for collecting version control data.
- We have updated the system to store log files for up to 30 days, compared to the previous duration of 7 days.
- We added a support for keyboard navigation in App Explorer on macOS and also for the modernized App Explorer on Windows.

### Fixes

- We fixed an issue when trying to filter by an attribute of an associated entity when the association is self-referencing many-to-one (Ticket #224145)
- We fixed an issue that prevented Native Bottom Bar styles from being applied.

- We fixed an issue where the garbage collector could clean up objects being returned from a microflow before they could be returned, leading to an error. (Ticket 222075)

- We fixed an issue where an Oops dialog was shown when opening the `Edit Datasource` dialog for data grid 2 after editing an expression, e.g. when editing the expression for the `Option caption` of the [association filter](https://docs.mendix.com/appstore/modules/data-grid-2/#association-filter). 

- We fixed an issue where an Oops dialog was shown when a generated column filter in a Data grid 2 is moved to another column.
- We fixed an issue in Firefox where the change event triggered before input validations were complete. (Ticket 223757)

- We fixed an issue in the Data grid 2 widget where setting a reference data source for filtering over associations in a column, triggered an automatic content generation.

- We fixed an issue that showed an "Oops" dialog when switching a template parameter from an attribute to an expression if the attribute no longer existed in the domain model.

- We fixed an issue that when a pluggable widget with a text template property, which is [conditionally hidden](https://docs.mendix.com/apidocs-mxsdk/apidocs/pluggable-widgets-config-api/#customizing-the-widgets-properties) in Studio Pro, would show up in the ['Changes pane'](https://docs.mendix.com/refguide/changes-pane/) when you changed something else on the widget. E.g. the 'Load more caption' of data grid 2 would show up as changed when you changed something else on data grid 2.
- We fixed an issue with the extension cache clean-up in Studio Pro that could result in issues with some extensions.
- We fixed an issue where on Mac sometimes a custom value would not be persisted when switching from XPath Builder to XPath Expression Editor or when pressing the OK button.
- We fixed an issue where importing a spreadsheet with a dollar sign in the data would in certain scenarios prevent the application from running (locally).
- We fixed a crash in Studio Pro that happened when using Shift+Enter in the Expression Editor. (tickets  #225645, #226153)
- We fixed an issue in the published OData services editor in Studio Pro, which would sometimes give an error about trying to show a published microflow when no published microflow was selected.
- We fixed an issue in consumed web services in Studio Pro where selecting a WSDL from a network drive that required authentication but did not return a WWW-Authenticate header would result in an error.
- We fixed an issue in the logic editors where adding an annotation would sometimes break displayed variable types
- In the logic editors, we fixed an issue where a Retrieve over association would not show the correct data type when it involved a generalization of an entity instead of the entity itself.
- In the logic editors, we fixed the highlighting of parameter objects when selected
- Disable highlighting text on right-click to text in logic editors
- We fixed an issue where a data validation error would trigger on a rollback or a delete. We now remove data validation errors for objects that are rolled back or deleted, also data validation that are manually added in a microflow. (Ticket #192090)
- We fixed an issue where roles assigned to a user are ignored momentarily during runtime. (Ticket #221900)
- We fixed an issue where building fails when a project that was created with StudioPro 9.24.0 or below containing jar exclusions is opened with newer versions. (Ticket #227102)
- We now correctly take into account the excluded jars of managed dependencies when compiling Java actions.
- We fixed an issue where Core.initializeSession(IUser, ..) was blocked by a database transaction lock in case of SQL Server with foreign keys enabled. (Ticket 226036)
- We fixed an issue where in some LibGit2 wasn't fetching extra objects while in partial mode.
- We fixed an issue where the icons for access rules in the new access rule editor were not clearly visible in dark mode.
- We fixed an issue where a native app would be stuck starting over and over again in case the authentication token was no longer valid. We now clear the authentication and session cookie in case they are no longer valid. (Ticket 225198)

### Deprecations

- We dropped support for MariaDB 10.4, as it is no longer supported by the vendor.

- Starting with version 10.17, we will drop support for PostgreSQL 12, as the vendor has announced the end of support for that version.

### Known Issues

- Currently, boundary events are scheduled when the guarded activity is started. This means for user tasks that the scheduling will happen before the targeting microflow finished running, which has implications on the timing of the UserTaskStarted event.
- When a failed activity with boundary events is retried, only the first level of boundary events is aborted/restarted. Lower nested boundary events are not aborted correctly.
- Currently when the workflow jumps back into an activity that already has a scheduled (timer) boundary event it will schedule another timer event. This is incorrect and will be fixed in a future release.
