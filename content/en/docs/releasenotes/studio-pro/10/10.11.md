## 10.11.0 {#10110}

**Release date: May ___ , 2024**

{{% button color="info" href="https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/studiopro/10.11.0" text="Go to Marketplace" title="Download version 10.11.0 from the Marketplace" %}}

### New Features

* Text box, Text area, and Date picker widgets now offer dynamic placeholders as Text templates with parameters.
* We added a preview of the auto-generated API documentation for published OData services to Studio Pro. This allows you to see the resulting REST endpoints of the OData service while you are modeling it.

### Java 21

We now support Java 21 in Studio Pro:
* This release ships with Java Development Kit (JDK) 21.
* You can now configure your application to use Java 21 in the **App Settings**.
* In **Preferences** you can configure a different JDK for each supported version of Java.
* Targeting Java 21 allows the project to use language constructs and APIs that were introduced with Java 21.
* Newly created projects will be configured to use Java 21 by default.

We recommend that you upgrade apps and Marketplace modules to Java 21.

### Improvements

* We changed the log level of the *Tasks cannot be executed anymore due to model changes* message in the task queue from **critical** to **error**.  (Ticket 199565)
* We now generate the exact same `vendorlib-sbom.json` file when dependencies do not change, reducing the amount of git conflicts related to this file. (Ticket 208993)
* We now pass a render mode to the pluggable widgets API to indicate which mode the page editor is in.
* We added a CanApplyJumpTo attribute to the System.Workflow entity that indicates whether it is allowed to apply a jump-to option to the workflow in its current state.
* We made some performance improvements when finding usages in protected modules.
* We added a **Support Tools** submenu to the **Help** menu, this submenu contains the following tools: Performance logging, Profiling, and Optimize MPR.
* We improved parameter validation while trying REST requests in consumed REST service editor (Beta). Requests having parameter values with spaces in URL will now raise errors as they do when used in microflow action.
* We upgraded react-navigation to version 6.x.x and extended navigation transitions options for Studio Pro.
* We added support for Hermes engine.
* Studio Pro version selector was visually overhauled and now supports dark and light modes.
* Studio Pro is now based on a .NET 8 instead of .NET 6. Therefore, .NET 8 is a new prerequisite for the application. For more information, see [System Requirements](/refguide/system-requirements/).
* With the new .NET 8 update, extension developers need to upgrade their respective extensions to target the new version of the framework.
* When using the React Client we no longer log incorrect warnings about missing imports of widgets in the app_bundle_log.txt when bundling the client.
* We improved the readability of XPath queries in the property field by trimming down the whitespaces.
* We updated some phrases in the XPath editor for more clarity.
* We made sure that right-clicking the context menu with cut, copy, paste, and delete options is available on the MendixChat feedback page.
* We fixed memory leaks that happened when closing and opening applications in Studio Pro.
* We do not allow user to provide invalid or duplicate request name in the consumed REST service document.
* We made some performance improvements to several operations in Studio Pro, including renaming entities, pasting in the domain model editor, copying and duplicating documents, and importing packages.
* We improved relay-outing in the logic editors: when adding objects to a loop, it only expands in the relevant direction(s).
* We have made a couple of small performance improvements to the Logic Bot.
* The menu items in the **View** menu are now ordered alphabetically and have individually assigned keyboard shortcuts.
* We improved consistency checks for parameters in the Consumed REST Request (beta) microflow action. Parameters with different casing are also marked as duplicate now.
* We added support for parameters in Path URL inside a Consumed REST service (beta) document.
* We now support parameters for string body content in a Consumed REST service (beta).
* We improved the **Integration** pane in Studio Pro. For associations between persistable and non-persistable entities where the non-persistable entity is the owner it now indicates that these are not supported. Before, these would appear supported, but using them always resulted in a consistency error.
* We made some performance improvements when finding usages of a module.
* In the microflow and nanoflow editors, flow lines are now rendered above other objects.
* We improved interaction with loops in the microflow and nanoflow editors. When a loop is not selected, you can now drag a selection rectangle from inside the loop to select its containing elements. To move the loop, simply click the loop to select it and then start dragging it to start moving.
* We added a small delay before showing the MxAssist Logic Bot blue dot.
* We added rendering support of Markdown tables, code blocks, and headers in MendixChat.

### Fixes

* We now support keyboard hotkeys for copy, cut, paste, undo, redo and also the delete key in MendixChat (Windows only).
We have fixed an issue when the new expression editor was getting stuck upon selecting a long suggestion in the auto completion popup.
* Killing a request will now interrupt running database actions. (Ticket 202924)
* We fixed an issue where, when migrating a column from Float to Decimal, the default value would be converted to Float before being inserted, which could cause improper rounding to happen.
* The Java API DataStorage.executeWithConnection (context, function) now properly closes the database connection when called from a Java action executed on a task queue. (Ticket 216659)
* We fixed a regression where using boolean microflow variables (or boolean attributes from an object microflow variable) in an XPath constraint would result in a runtime exception "Unexpected expression in predicate position". (Ticket 216792)
* We fixed an issue in OQL where subtracting the `null` literal would cause subsequent `null` literal usages to throw a parsing exception.
* When using MySQL as the database, setting a query timeout works again.
* We resolved an issue in Studio Pro where an error would occur when attempting to open preferences while creating a new app.
* We fixed an issue where the CSS of widgets was not being applied properly during development using the React client. (Ticket 214211)
* We resolved an issue in Document Templates that prevented custom `height` and `width` style attributes from being applied when generating HTML files. (Ticket 214622)
* We resolved an issue causing files with special characters in their names to download with incorrect filenames. (Ticket 213587)
* We fixed an issue where aborting a workflow could result in an error if the workflow has an ongoing activity that just finished
* We fixed an issue where an error in the client occurred when a client side expression which uses a selection variable was used in a snippet. (Ticket 207899)
* We fixed an issue where Data Grid 2 did not show data in some columns when different columns were configured with an attribute path using the same association but different specialization or generalization entities. (Ticket 203959)
* We fixed an issue where a pluggable widget with a [selection property](https://docs.mendix.com/apidocs-mxsdk/apidocs/pluggable-widgets-property-types/#selection) linked to a [datasource property](https://docs.mendix.com/apidocs-mxsdk/apidocs/pluggable-widgets-property-types/#datasource) which is not
required would result in an exception when the datasource was not configured. 
* We fixed the issue that popups in Studio Pro would sometimes appear on the wrong display. (Ticket 215250)
* We fixed an issue in the new expression editor when the cursor was jumping to the end of the expression upon typing. This cursor issue could also lead to unexpected behaviour with IME characters (Ticket 205514, 216915).
We fixed an exception that happened upon closing a non-version controlled app (after we previously opened a version controlled app & did not restart studio-pro).
* We fixed an issue in the [Core.RetrieveByPath](https://apidocs.rnd.mendix.com/10/runtime/com/mendix/core/Core.html) Runtime API, where having a new external object and retrieving over an association from the child's side would result in an error.
* We fixed an issue where Studio Pro allowed publishing an OData service that included invalid associations between readable
and non-readable associations. Readable entities now only allow associations to only other readable entities.
* We fixed an issue with private constant values in mxbuild. It would give an error when deploying an app where the first local run configuration had a private constant value. (Ticket 214945)
* We fixed the positioning issue of `Extract Flow` in logic editors.
* We fixed the disappearing issue of activity badges while dragging activities in the logic editors
* We fixed an issue where renaming a document (entity, association, module) was not reflected correctly in expressions.
* We fixed scrolling left/right when pressing shift while using the scroll wheel
*  Fixed issue where disabling a Scheduled Event through Model Options in Sprintr would not work. (Ticket 214392, 215703, 215843)

### Deprecations

* Starting with version 10.12, we will drop support for MariaDB 10.4, as the vendor has announced the end of support for that version.

### Known Issues

* Line endings in CSS files are not being handled properly, so when using [Revert All Changes](/refguide/using-version-control-in-studio-pro/) or performing other version-control operations, CSS files appear in the [Changes on Disk](/refguide/version-control-menu/#show-changes) dialog box.
    * Workaround: For details, see [this section](/refguide/troubleshoot-version-control-issues/#css-error) in *Troubleshooting Version Control*.
* When typing an expression in the new expression editor, the cursor jumps to the end of the text.
    * Workaround: You can switch back to the old editor via **Preferences** > [New Features](/refguide/preferences-dialog/#new-features).
* Disabling Custom Scheduled Events in the **App Settings** > **Configurations** has no effect and they will still run on their scheduled time. Toggling on a disabled Scheduled Event will also have no effect. 
    * Workaround: Making a small change to the model in Studio Pro, such as adding a comment to a microflow, and then redeploying and restarting the app will update the status of the Scheduled Events.
* A finished parallel split path that is removed from a running workflow instance wrongly leads to a versioning conflict. Please note that "path" was called "branch" in earlier versions.
* Studio Pro on Mac loads user settings from the previous version of the application.
