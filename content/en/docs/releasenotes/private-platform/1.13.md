## 1.13.0

### Release date: August 30, 2024

Version 1.13.0 of Private Mendix Platform introduces a number of bug fixes and improvements.

#### Improvements

###### Build and Deploy Enhancements

The Build and Deploy process can now be triggered by using an API call. 

Dynamic role management is available for Build and Deploy on Kubernetes. Role management is now granular - instead of one permission list for all purposes, each member now has separate roles for each DTAP purpose, and can be granted different roles or permissions for each different purpose.

###### Webhook Enhancements

You can now customize the payload for webhooks. You can input both static text and variables.

##### Engineering Improvements

* Azure Blob is supported for Kubernetes build output.
* Logs are now generated when the Deployment pipeline is triggered.

###### Studio Pro Updates

* Studio Pro 9.24 LTS latest patch version updated to [9.24.26](/releasenotes/studio-pro/9.24/#92426)
* Studio Pro 10.6 MTS latest patch version updated to [10.6.12](/releasenotes/studio-pro/10.6/#10612) 

#### Fixes

We have provided the following fixes:

* (Platform) We have added email validation for the New User form.
* (Platform) We have fixed some issues related to the Build pipeline.
* (Platform) We have resolved a merge error that occurred for CI/CD pipelines with a decision tree.
* (Platform) For governance reasons, we have restricted the ability to edit user names, so that the option is no longer available to non-admin users.
* (UI) We have fixed some UI-related issues.

#### Known Issues

##### Cluster Manager Members Removed After Upgrade

After upgrading Private Mendix Platform to ver. 1.13, any members previously defined in the Cluster Manager settings are removed.

###### Cause

Because of the implementation of dynamic role management, previously created members are incompatible with the new options and must be recreated. In previous releases of Private Mendix Platform, there was only one global role for all DTAP purposes, so all members were created with one permission list for all purposes. Starting in ver. 1.13, there are three role options (*Cluster Member*, *Cluster Admin* and *Custom*) for each of the four deployment purposes (DTAP), which correspond to the specified purpose of the deployment environment. Because of that, member roles could not be mapped or inherited between the releases.

###### Solution

After the upgrade, manually add the members that were removed from each namespace in the Cluster Manager settings.
