## BMPN 2.0

In BPMN 2.0, boundary events are a type of event that is attached to the boundary of an activity (such as a task or subprocess) to handle exceptional situations or are triggered by certain behaviours. The icon inside the event indicates the type of event (e.g. clock indicates itâ€™s a timer event). Boundary Events are always displayed by 2 circles (either solid or dashed) and are linked by a dotted line to the parent activity. 

There are two main types of boundary events:

- Non-Interrupting Boundary Events: These events do not interrupt the ongoing activity. When triggered, they allow the activity to continue while simultaneously starting a new path from the boundary event. As per BPMN2.0 specification, non-interrupting boundary events are visualised as two dashed circles with an icon in the center.

- Interrupting Boundary Events: When these events are triggered, they interrupt the normal path of the activity they are attached to. The activity stops, and the process flow is redirected to the boundary event's outgoing sequence path. As per BPMN2.0 specification, interrupting boundary events are visualised as two solid circles.

## Types

Within the current release of the boundary events, Studio Pro has support for one type of boundary event being the timer boundary event.

|-------- | -------- | --------|

## Supporting activities

The following activities have support for the new boundary events.

## Getting started

To get started with the new boundary events feature, these can be enabled by opening Studio Pro's settings and navigating to new features (this setting is only applicable during the beta).

- Windows: Preferences -> New Features -> Enable non-interrupting timer boundary events (beta)
- Mac (Beta): Preferences -> New Features -> Enable non-interrupting timer boundary events (beta)

## Adding Timer Boundary Events

To add a boundary event to one of these activities there are 2 ways:

1. Select an Event activity (currently only Timer event is available) from the workflow Toolbox and drag it on one of the activities listed above. Double click the Timer Boundary Event icon to open the Timer properties dialog.

{{< figure src="/attachments/refguide/modeling/application-logic/workflows/workflow-how-to-boundary-events/drag-drop.png" alt="Adding boundary events through drag and drop" width="200" class="no-border">}}

2. Open the activity (e.g. User Task) properties (1), go to the Events tab (2) and create a new boundary event (3). Select the Timer event (4).

{{< figure src="/attachments/refguide/modeling/application-logic/workflows/workflow-how-to-boundary-events/edit-dialog.png" alt="Adding boundary events through edit dialog" width="450" class="no-border">}}

The next step is to configure the boundary timer properties like Caption and timer Duration. This could be a fixed period (after the parent task is initiated) or a date+time can be defined in an expression. For more information see [Timer Event](/refguide/timer-event/).

## Rearranging

You can change the ordering of the boundary event in 2 ways:

1. Via the context menu (right mouse click) of the timer event and select **Move boundary event left** or **Move boundary event right**, or by using the keyboard shortcuts [Keyboard Shortcuts](/refguide/keyboard-shortcuts/#editors-only).
 
{{< figure src="/attachments/refguide/modeling/application-logic/workflows/workflow-elements/boundary-events/arrange-in-editor.png" width="350px" alt="Timer Event arrange in editor" class="no-border" >}}

2. Open the edit dialog of the parent activity and change the order of the boundary event paths by altering the list. Note that this does not change the order execution of the paths, as this is dependent on the expiration of the timer

## Execution

Boundary events are initiated when their parent activity is initiated. For example, for a timer with a fixed duration, it will start its count down when the parent activity is initiated. In case the parent activity is completed before any of the boundary events are triggered, none of the activities in the boundary event path will be executed and all timers will be cancelled.

With non-interrupting boundary events the parent activity remains active/in progress when an event is triggered (i.e., the parent activity is not interrupted). For example, when a timer event on a user task is triggered after 2 days, this task will remain in progress and the path defined below the timer event is executed. When the boundary event path reaches the **End of Boundary Path** activity, the workflow will await the completion of the parent activity. 

## Current Limitations

The current release (10.15) of boundary events has the following functional limitations (which are actively being developed):

- No access to data of the parent activity in the boundary path. For user tasks we will soon add a variable **$ParentTask** which is available in the boundary event path of a user task (e.g. do get the assigned user that should receive a notification when a task is overdue). Same for $CalledWorkflowInstance in case the parent activity is a Call workflow activity.
- Non-interrupting timer boundary events have no recurrence (they are only executed once and will not repeat). This attribute will be added in a future update.
