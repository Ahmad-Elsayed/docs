## BMPN 2.0

In BPMN 2.0, boundary events are a type of event that is attached to the boundary of an activity (such as a task or subprocess) to handle exceptional situations or to trigger certain behaviours. The icon inside the event indicates the type of event (e.g. clock indicates itâ€™s a timer event). Boundary Events are always displayed by 2 circles (either solid or dashed) and are linked by a dotted line to the parent activity. 

There are two main types of boundary events:

- Non-Interrupting Boundary Events: These events do not interrupt the ongoing activity. When triggered, they allow the activity to continue while simultaneously starting a new flow from the boundary event. As per BPMN2.0 specification, non-interrupting boundary events are visualised as two dashed circles with an icon in the center.

- Interrupting Boundary Events: When these events are triggered, they interrupt the normal flow of the activity they are attached to. The activity stops, and the process flow is redirected to the boundary event's outgoing sequence flow. As per BPMN2.0 specification, interrupting boundary events are visualised as two solid circles.

## Types

Within the current release of the boundary events, Studio Pro has support for one type of boundary event being the timer boundary event.

|-------- | -------- | --------|

## Rearranging

You can change the ordering of the boundary event in 2 ways:

1. Via the context menu (right mouse click) of the timer event and select **Move boundary event left** or **Move boundary event right**, or by using the keyboard shortcuts [Keyboard Shortcuts](/refguide/keyboard-shortcuts/#editors-only).

nge the order of the boundary event flows on the canvas. Note that this does not change the order execution of the flows, as this is dependent on the expiration of the timer
