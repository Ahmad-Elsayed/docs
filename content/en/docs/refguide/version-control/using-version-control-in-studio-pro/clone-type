Different clone types were introduced in Mendix version 10.12.
{{% /alert %}}

## 1 Introduction

The Git version control system defaults to downloading a full copy of the repository on the server. Studio Pro allows you to select a different mechanism for cloning to optimize for your needs, such as working offline, or working with a large repository.

## 2 Clone types

Currently Studio Pro supports two different clones types.

### 2.1 Full clone

### 2.2 Partial clone

### 2.3 Choosing a clone type



## 3 Preferences

You can change the [Clone type](/refguide/preferences-dialog/#git) for future clone operations, such as downloading an app or checking out another branch of an app you already downloaded. Changing this setting will not affect apps that you have already downloaded.

## 4 Changing clone type
