## Introduction

This section of the Private Mendix Platform Reference Guide provides information about the menus and functionalities of the Private Mendix Platform that are common for administrator and developer users.

### Sign In

The initial login screen is the same for all users, whether or not they have administrator access rights. The following login methods are available:

* A local user login with a username and password
* Optionally, an SSO login which redirects to an SSO provider

After signing in, all users regardless of their role are initially directed to the **My Apps** page. Users with the administrator role can switch to admin view by clicking the user icon in the top right corner, and then selecting **Switch to Admin Mode**.

### Top Navigation Bar

The top navigation bar displays your location within the Platform (for example, *Apps* or *Marketplace*). The branding of the bar, such as the logo and title, can be customized by a Company Admin.

From the navigation bar, you can access the following items:

* **Platform Navigation** (({{% icon name="layout-1-filled" %}}))
* **Notification Center** (({{% icon name="alarm-bell" %}}))
* **Account Menu**
