## Introduction

Located in the [navigation pane](/developerportal/#navigation-pane) of **Apps**, Buzz lets you see your app activity as well as collaborate and share ideas with your team. 

{{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/general/buzz/app-buzz.png" >}}

On the top of the page you will see some basic information about your app

* The App **logo**, **name**, and **description**. If no **description** is provided, we write a placeholder text. If you're a project administrator, you can change any of these details in the [Settings](/developerportal/collaborate/general-settings) page
* The name of the **company** owning the app
* The **cloud target** where your app is deployed, and, if the target is the public Mendix cloud, the **license state** of the app
* The date of the **last commit** to the main line of your app. This information is only available if you have team server access to the app
* The **Mendix version** of your app on main line. This information is only available if you have team server access to the app

You can see the size of your **Team** and your team members on the right side of the page. Up to 25 team members can be displayed here at a time.

Click **Invite someone to your team** ({{% icon name="add-circle" %}}) to invite new members to your team directly. Click **Show All** to go to the [Team](/developerportal/general/team/) page for the app.

Once you have posted a comment, you can click **Edit** to **Update Message** or **Delete**. You can also **Reply in Thread** to comments left by colleagues.
