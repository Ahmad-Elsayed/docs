## Introduction

You can use the **Environments** page to access information about your environments, deploy packages, manage certificates and access restrictions, and more. To access your app's **Environments** page, go to [Apps](https://sprintr.home.mendix.com/) and click **Environments** on your app. You can also directly visit the **Environments** page using this link:  `https://cloud.home.mendix.com/link/deploy/{appID}`, with `{app ID}` replaced by your app ID.

The **Environments** page has the following tabs:

* **Overview**
