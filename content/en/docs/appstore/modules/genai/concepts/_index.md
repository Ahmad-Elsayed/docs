# Introduction


## 1 The LLM

### 1.1 What is an LLM?

* Large Language Model or GPT (generic pretrained transformer) allows you to use (generative) AI for a variety of use cases
* What is an LLM?
* Wat can an LLM do?
* What is an LLM not?

### 1.2 Making an LLM more specific

1. Prompt engineering
2. Ground in data with RAG & ReAct
3. Advanced capabilities such as finetuning and training your own model

When executed well you can use Prompt Engineering, RAG and ReAct to build many use cases and you would not need finetuning.

## 2 Prompt engineering

For more details see PROMPT ENGINEERING.

## 3 Ground in data with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)

### 3.1 Bedrock Retrieval Augmented Generation

### 3.2 Azure AI Search

### 3.3 PgVector Knowledge Base

## 4 Interact with your application through the ReAct pattern (function calling)

## 5 Agents

### 5.1 Connect to a Bedrock Agent
