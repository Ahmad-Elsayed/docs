## 1 Introduction

Amazon Bedrock is a fully managed service that makes foundation models (FMs) from Amazon and leading AI startups available through an API, so you can choose from various FMs to find the model that is best suited for your use case. With the Amazon Bedrock serverless experience, you can quickly get started, easily experiment with FMs, and seamlessly integrate and deploy them into your applications using AWS tools and capabilities. Therefor, it offers a great alternative to the OpenAI connector. Available model families include

* AI21Labs Jurassic
* Amazon Titan
* Anthropic Claude
* Cohere Command and Embed
* Meta Llama
* Mistral AI
* Snowflake Arctic
* Stability AI Stable Diffusion XL
