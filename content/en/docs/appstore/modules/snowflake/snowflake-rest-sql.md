## 1 Introduction

{DESCRIBE THE MODULE.}

### 1.1 Typical Use Cases

{DESCRIBE WHAT THE MODULE IS TYPICALLY USED FOR.}

### 1.2 Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

The {CONNECTOR NAME} connector requires Mendix Studio Pro version {REQUIRED VERSION} or above.

{OTHER PREREQUISITES AS REQUIRED.}

### 1.3 Licensing and Cost

This connector is available as a free download from the Mendix Marketplace.

{INFORMATION ABOUT SNOWFLAKE LICENSING REQUIREMENTS, IF ANY}

Depending on your use case, your deployment environment, and the type of app that you want to build, you may also need a license for your Mendix app. For more information, refer to [Licensing Apps](/developerportal/deploy/licensing-apps-outside-mxcloud/).

## 2 Installation

Follow the instructions in [How to Use Marketplace Content in Studio Pro](/appstore/general/app-store-content/) to import the {CONNECTOR NAME} connector into your app.

## 3 Configuration

After you install the connector, you can find it in the **App Explorer**, in the **{MODULENAME}** section. The connector provides a [domain model](#domain-model) and several [activities](#activities) that you can use to connect your app to {AWS SERVICE NAME}. Each activity can be implemented by using it in a microflow. To ensure that your app can connect to the AWS service, you must also configure AWS authentication for the connector.

### 3.1 Configuring Snowflake Authentication

{INFORMATION ABOUT AUTHENTICATING IN SNOWFLAKE}

### 3.2 Configuring a Microflow for the Service

After you configure the authentication profile for {SERVICE NAME}, you can implement the functions of the connector by using the provided activities in microflows. For example, to {DESCRIBE A TASK}, implement the {ACTIVITY NAME, WITH LINK TO THE RELEVANT SECTION IN TECHNICAL REFERENCE BELOW} activity by doing the following steps:

{A DETAILED STEP-BY-STEP CONFIGURATION PROCEDURE, WITH SCREENSHOTS. SEE THE DYNAMODB CONNECTOR DOC FOR THE LEVEL OF DETAIL THAT'S REQUIRED.}

## 4 Technical Reference

To help you work with the {CONNECTOR NAME} connector, the following sections of this document list the available entities, enumerations, and activities that you can use in your application.

### 4.1 Domain Model {#domain-model}

The domain model is a data model that describes the information in your application domain in an abstract way. For more information, see [Domain Model](/refguide/domain-model/).

The entities in the table below describe all generalizations. These are reused by the different models for the specific microflow activities or for storing connection details.

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| {ENTITY NAME} | {ENTITY DESCRIPTION} |

### 4.2 Enumerations

An enumeration is a predefined list of values that can be used as an attribute type. For the {CONNECTOR NAME} connector, enumerations list values such as {AS REQUIRED}.

#### 4.2.1 `{ENUMERATION NAME}`

| Name | Caption | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| {ENUMERATION ELEMENT NAME} | {ENUMERATION ELEMENT VALUE} | {ENUMERATION ELEMENT DESCRIPTION} |

### 4.3 Activities {#activities}

Activities define the actions that are executed in a microflow or a nanoflow. For the {CONNECTOR NAME} connector, they {PURPOSE OF THE ACTIVITIES}.

#### 4.3.1 {ACTIVITY NAME}

The `{ACTIVITYNAME}` {AWS SERVICE NAME} activity allows you to {ACTIVITY PURPOSE}. It requires {REQUIRED PARAMETERS}. {OPTIONAL, IF THE ACTIVITY HAS NO OUTPUT: "This activity has no return value.
"}

The input and output for this service are shown in the table below:

| Input | Output |
| --- | --- |
| `{INPUT OBJECT}` | `{OUTPUT OBJECT}` |

##### OPTIONAL, INCLUDE ONLY IF THE ACTIVITY RETURNS AN OUTPUT:

This activity returns a `{OUTPUT OBJECT}` object with objects from the following entities, as shown in the table below:

| Name |    Generalization |    Documentation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `{ENTITY NAME}` | `{ENTITY GENERALIZATION}` | {ENTITY DESCRIPTION} |
