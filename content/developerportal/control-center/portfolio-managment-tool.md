## 1 Introduction

The [portfolio management tool](https://portfolio.mendix.com) empowers you to manage your projects throughout the project lifecycle â€“ from it starts as an idea until it is live. Here, you have an overview of all projects, the stages of each project in the form of a Kanban board, the timeline and estimated value for each project, and much more.

You need to log in to access the portfolio management tool. When you open the portfolio management tool, the system checks if you have access to any portfolios, and if so, you will see all the portfolios to which you have access.

If you are an administrator of your company, you can access all the portfolios of your company.

If you are an administrator of your company, and there are no portfolio of your company, the system will create a portfolio for your company.

You can be invited to access the portfolios of your company and also the portfolio outside your company.

Click the portfolio to see the overview of all the projects in this portfolio.
